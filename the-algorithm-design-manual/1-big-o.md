# Big O Notation

## Classes

### Constant O(1)

Such functions might measure the cost of adding two numbers or executing print statements. In the big picture, there is no dependence on the parameter n.

### Logarithmic O(log n)

Shows up in algorithms such as binary search. Such functions grow slowly as n gets big, but faster than constant functions.

### Linear O(n)

Such functions measure the cost of looking at each item once in an n-element array.

### Super Linear O(n lg n)

This important class of functions arises in such algorithms as Quicksort and Mergesort.

### Quadratic O(n^2)

Such functions measure the cost of looking at most or all pairs of items in an n-element universe. For example, insertion sort and selection sort.

### Cubic O(n^3)

Such functions enumerate through all triples of items in an n-element universe. These arise in certain dynamic programming algorithms.

### Exponential O(n^n)

Functions like this arise when enumerating all subsets of n items.

### Factorial O(n!)

Functions like this arise when generating all permutations or orderings of n items.
