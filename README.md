# Computer Science

Study notes from the books listed on [Teach Yourself Computer Science](https://teachyourselfcs.com/).
For the most part used as a basic structure that I then supplement with other sources.

## Subjects

- **Programming**: Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs.
- **Computer Architecture**: Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective.
- ❗ **Algorithms & Data Structures**: The Algorithm Design Manual.
- **Math for CS**: Mathematics for Computer Science.
- **Operating Systems**: Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces.
- ❗ **Computer Networking**: Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach.
- **Databases**: Readings in Database Systems.
- **Languages and Compilers**: Crafting Interpreters.
- ❗ **Distributed Systems**: Designing Data Intensive Applications.

> ❗ = priority

## Supplementary

- **Architecture**: Clean Architecture: A Craftsman's Guide to Software Structure and Design.
- **Programming**: Code Complete: A Practical Handbook of Software Construction.
- **OOP**: Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software.
- **Programming**: Domain-Driven Design: Tackling Complexity in the Heart of Software.
- **Architecture**: Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture.
- **Programming**: Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship.

> This book seems to get a lot of hate lately. I will proceed with caution but the bit of reading I have done has proven useful.

## Rustlang for Examples

For code examples I have opted to use a low-level language over something like Javascript or Python. Using a high-level language to implement a linked-list for example feels counter-intuitive, and the language would not care about lower level details like memory management, which is a key point of this learning exercise.

When it comes to choosing a low-level language, I have chosen Rustlang over C for the following reasons:

- Helpful compiler error messages which might function as a tutor.
- Modern DX which gets less in the way of learning.
- Expressive syntax.
- Adoption in web. Many tools I have an interest in contributing to or making use of use Rust.

> That all said, who knows, I might be wrong; this is a bit of an experiment. At the very least I can say that it excites me and that maybe is enough of a reason to use it.
